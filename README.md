# queue-management-2
A queue-managment system to aid in better serving customers and recording statistics

This project was built to keep statistics of people who visited the `virtual lab` at The University of Ottawa.
It recorded from which faculty most students and professors visited, displayed who was next in line and the station they occupied.
